## Electrons

All electronic devices operation is based on how electrons move. We are all made by them, but it somehow difficult sometimes to visualize them. 

In the following video we can get a clue. Electrons are located on the circle in the end of the video.

In the following image(*) we can see a sketch of how they orbit around the atom kernel.

Electrons move very fast. When we managed to control their movement, we started creating all these nice electronics devices.

To push the electrons we need voltage. We get voltage from a battery. The more volts a battery has, the more powerful it can be and the stronger it can push the electrons.

Electrons need a path to move. Usually we use cables for this reason.

In the first step we will play a game in order to understand what is happening with the electrons.

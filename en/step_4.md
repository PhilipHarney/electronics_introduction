## Game of Electrons

With this game we will understand what is happening with the electrons.

A mentor (or a teacher) unwraps the rope and puts its edges under their feet, one under the left and the other under the right.

The rope should make a circle in front of them.

The opposite side of the rope should come close to a table where the light item (eg pencil) will be placed.

The mentor declares that they are the battery and the children are the electrons.

They push the children, which should travel in parallel with the rope.

Each children that reaches the pencil, it raises it up and places it down and continues its trip.

When they reach the mentor, the mentor pushes them again.

The mentor explains that the pencil is the LED that is lit due to the electrons.

After a while, they make a break and the mentor explains to them that if they let them run to fast, the LED could be damaged.

This is the reason that they will put a stool on some part of the rope.

The stool is there to prevent them from running to fast.

In an actual circuit this is the job of the resistor.

The mentor and the children play the game again using the stool.
